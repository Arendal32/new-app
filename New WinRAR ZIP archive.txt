 Today, I'd like to discuss a movement that emerged in response to the tragic events at Douglas High School in 2018â€”the 'March for Our Lives.'
 This movement is driven by the need to prevent gun violence and ensure the safety of students and the public. Throughout our discussion, we'll explore the goals, key initiatives, and impact of March for Our Lives in its mission to create a safer future for us all.
1. prevent gun violence, as a main goal, reduce and prevent gun violence in schools and communities.
2.Background Checks: Ensuring that everyone purchasing a gun undergoes a thorough background check to assess their suitability and potential risk.
3.Ban on Assault Weapons: Advocating for a ban on the sale and possession of assault weapons to reduce the potential for mass shootings.
